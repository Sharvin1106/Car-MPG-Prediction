# Car MPG Prediction

<p align="center"><i>A SVM Regressor model was created to predict car MPG</i></p>

## Introduction

<p> We were assigned to create a machine learning model which is SVM regressor to predict the car MPG. We performed some data cleaning, data exploration and built the model.<br>We did performed feature selection to choose the right number of features to train our model. Hence for feature selection we used the wrapper method. We also fine tuned the hyperparameters using GridSearchCV library </p>
